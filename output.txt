-((-p^(q^-r))>q) is a negation.  -((-p^(q^-r))>q) is not satisfiable.
(-p^(q^r)) is a binary. The first part is -p and the second part is (q^r).  (-p^(q^r)) is satisfiable.
--((p>-p)^(p->q)) is not a formula.  I told you, --((p>-p)^(p->q)) is not a formula.
-(p^q^r) is not a formula.  I told you, -(p^q^r) is not a formula.
(((p>q)>(q>p))^-q) is a binary. The first part is ((p>q)>(q>p)) and the second part is -q.  (((p>q)>(q>p))^-q) is satisfiable.
-(p>(q>p)) is a negation.  -(p>(q>p)) is not satisfiable.
----p is a negation.  ----p is satisfiable.
(--pv-p) is a binary. The first part is --p and the second part is -p.  (--pv-p) is satisfiable.
-(p^q) is a negation.  -(p^q) is satisfiable.
(-qv(p>q)) is a binary. The first part is -q and the second part is (p>q).  (-qv(p>q)) is satisfiable.
